He is a plain-looking schoolboy with a round face. A straight and upright3 kid, he displays few features of the typical heroes like Superman*, Spiderman* or Batman*. Rather, his name has become a synonym4 for the eternal loser: we say \"He is a real Charlie Brown.\"\n\n\tHe loses countless baseball games and often gets tricked by Lucy van Pelt* when he is trying to kick a football. He never plays a game of checkers* without getting beaten, and he never manages to successfully fly a kite.

He is prone5 to depression and anxiety, constantly wonders if he is liked or respected, and always hopes for people\u2019s approval6 and acceptance7. But he is a lovable child with a good heart and endless determination and hope. His stories strike a sympathetic chord with millions of people.\n\n\tThere are naturally many similarities between Charlie Brown and Charles M. Schulz*, the cartoonist who created Peanuts. As a matter of fact, Charles Schulz once indicated that Peanuts is autobiographical. Like Charlie Brown\u2019s parents, Schulz\u2019s father was a barber8 and his mother a housewife. Like Charlie Brown, he was timid9 and withdrawn10, and he kept a dog as a pet. Like Charlie Brown, he played for his neighborhood baseball team, and like Charlie Brown, the worried young Schulz couldn\u2019t sleep on the night before a game. Failure11 and rejection were the two themes that dominated Schulz\u2019s childhood12 and early adulthood. There is even a similarity in their names \u2014 Charlie is a nickname13 for Charles.\n\n\tThe popular saying \u201cThe harder you fall, the higher you bounce14 back\u201d is definitely true of Schulz. He made up his mind to become a cartoonist when he was seven, but his initial15 works kept getting rejected. Years later, he said he could still remember vividly \u201cthe sinking16 feeling\u201d when he received rejection notes in the mail. In World War II, Schulz was drafted into the military. After the war, he lost at least three girlfriends because they had fallen in love with other men. In 1947, he traveled to Chicago to show his works to some prospective17 publishers, only to be rejected by all of them. His response was to go back home and keep drawing, and he constantly refined his illustrations18. He took the rejections as constructive19 criticism20 and an opportunity to improve himself. Even when his own mother didn\u2019t believe in his dreams, he didn\u2019t give up. Schulz said later, \u201cI was never discouraged. I always knew I was getting closer and closer.\u201d His perseverance eventually led to the creation of Peanuts, which soon became one of the most influential and well-received comic strips of all time. He never blamed21 anyone for his failures along the way. In fact, he gave credit to his failures for making him more determined to finally achieve success22.\n\n\tThis is the spirit that the author23 attempts to convey in his comic strips.

		"en_content": "Charlie Brown is one of the main characters, along with Snoopy* and others, in the extremely popular American comic strip1 Peanuts*, the longest-running comic strip in the world with a readership2 of 355 million worldwide.\n\n\tCharlie is an unusual choice for a hero. He is a plain-looking schoolboy with a round face. A straight and upright3 kid, he displays few features of the typical heroes like Superman*, Spiderman* or Batman*. Rather, his name has become a synonym4 for the eternal loser: we say \"He is a real Charlie Brown.\"\n\n\tHe loses countless baseball games and often gets tricked by Lucy van Pelt* when he is trying to kick a football. He never plays a game of checkers* without getting beaten, and he never manages to successfully fly a kite. What\u2019s worse, he never gets valentines* or Christmas cards; he only gets rocks when he goes trick-or-treating on Halloween. He is prone5 to depression and anxiety, constantly wonders if he is liked or respected, and always hopes for people\u2019s approval6 and acceptance7. But he is a lovable child with a good heart and endless determination and hope. His stories strike a sympathetic chord with millions of people.\n\n\tThere are naturally many similarities between Charlie Brown and Charles M. Schulz*, the cartoonist who created Peanuts. As a matter of fact, Charles Schulz once indicated that Peanuts is autobiographical. Like Charlie Brown\u2019s parents, Schulz\u2019s father was a barber8 and his mother a housewife. Like Charlie Brown, he was timid9 and withdrawn10, and he kept a dog as a pet. Like Charlie Brown, he played for his neighborhood baseball team, and like Charlie Brown, the worried young Schulz couldn\u2019t sleep on the night before a game. Failure11 and rejection were the two themes that dominated Schulz\u2019s childhood12 and early adulthood. There is even a similarity in their names \u2014 Charlie is a nickname13 for Charles.\n\n\tThe popular saying \u201cThe harder you fall, the higher you bounce14 back\u201d is definitely true of Schulz. He made up his mind to become a cartoonist when he was seven, but his initial15 works kept getting rejected. Years later, he said he could still remember vividly \u201cthe sinking16 feeling\u201d when he received rejection notes in the mail. In World War II, Schulz was drafted into the military. After the war, he lost at least three girlfriends because they had fallen in love with other men. In 1947, he traveled to Chicago to show his works to some prospective17 publishers, only to be rejected by all of them. His response was to go back home and keep drawing, and he constantly refined his illustrations18. He took the rejections as constructive19 criticism20 and an opportunity to improve himself. Even when his own mother didn\u2019t believe in his dreams, he didn\u2019t give up. Schulz said later, \u201cI was never discouraged. I always knew I was getting closer and closer.\u201d His perseverance eventually led to the creation of Peanuts, which soon became one of the most influential and well-received comic strips of all time. He never blamed21 anyone for his failures along the way. In fact, he gave credit to his failures for making him more determined to finally achieve success22.\n\n\tThis is the spirit that the author23 attempts to convey in his comic strips. Charlie Brown never blames or takes revenge24 on those who defeat him or let him down. He keeps trying to fly a kite and keeps going to the baseball mound25 over and over again, hoping to pitch26 a winning game. He firmly believes that he will make it big someday, however difficult or unlikely that may be. \u201cDetermined\u201d is a better word to describe him than \u201cstubborn27.\u201d Life is full of frustrations and setbacks for him, and perhaps for most people.

He is a plain-looking schoolboy with a round face. A straight and upright3 kid, he displays few features of the typical heroes like Superman*, Spiderman* or Batman*. Rather, his name has become a synonym4 for the eternal loser: we say \"He is a real Charlie Brown.\"\n\n\tHe loses countless baseball games and often gets tricked by Lucy van Pelt* when he is trying to kick a football. He never plays a game of checkers* without getting beaten, and he never manages to successfully fly a kite. What\u2019s worse, he never gets valentines* or Christmas cards; he only gets rocks when he goes trick-or-treating on Halloween. He is prone5 to depression and anxiety, constantly wonders if he is liked or respected, and always hopes for people\u2019s approval6 and acceptance7. But he is a lovable child with a good heart and endless determination and hope. His stories strike a sympathetic chord with millions of people.\n\n\tThere are naturally many similarities between Charlie Brown and Charles M. Schulz*, the cartoonist who created Peanuts. As a matter of fact, Charles Schulz once indicated that Peanuts is autobiographical. Like Charlie Brown\u2019s parents, Schulz\u2019s father was a barber8 and his mother a housewife. Like Charlie Brown, he was timid9 and withdrawn10, and he kept a dog as a pet. Like Charlie Brown, he played for his neighborhood baseball team, and like Charlie Brown, the worried young Schulz couldn\u2019t sleep on the night before a game. Failure11 and rejection were the two themes that dominated Schulz\u2019s childhood12 and early adulthood. There is even a similarity in their names \u2014 Charlie is a nickname13 for Charles.\n\n\tThe popular saying \u201cThe harder you fall, the higher you bounce14 back\u201d is definitely true of Schulz. He made up his mind to become a cartoonist when he was seven, but his initial15 works kept getting rejected. Years later, he said he could still remember vividly \u201cthe sinking16 feeling\u201d when he received rejection notes in the mail. In World War II, Schulz was drafted into the military. After the war, he lost at least three girlfriends because they had fallen in love with other men. In 1947, he traveled to Chicago to show his works to some prospective17 publishers, only to be rejected by all of them. His response was to go back home and keep drawing, and he constantly refined his illustrations18. He took the rejections as constructive19 criticism20 and an opportunity to improve himself. Even when his own mother didn\u2019t believe in his dreams, he didn\u2019t give up. Schulz said later, \u201cI was never discouraged. I always knew I was getting closer and closer.\u201d His perseverance eventually led to the creation of Peanuts, which soon became one of the most influential and well-received comic strips of all time. He never blamed21 anyone for his failures along the way. In fact, he gave credit to his failures for making him more determined to finally achieve success22.\n\n\tThis is the spirit that the author23 attempts to convey in his comic strips. Charlie Brown never blames or takes revenge24 on those who defeat him or let him down. He keeps trying to fly a kite and keeps going to the baseball mound25 over and over again, hoping to pitch26 a winning game.

		"en_content": "Charlie Brown is one of the main characters, along with Snoopy* and others, in the extremely popular American comic strip1 Peanuts*, the longest-running comic strip in the world with a readership2 of 355 million worldwide.\n\n\tCharlie is an unusual choice for a hero. He is a plain-looking schoolboy with a round face. A straight and upright3 kid, he displays few features of the typical heroes like Superman*, Spiderman* or Batman*. Rather, his name has become a synonym4 for the eternal loser: we say \"He is a real Charlie Brown.\"\n\n\tHe loses countless baseball games and often gets tricked by Lucy van Pelt* when he is trying to kick a football. He never plays a game of checkers* without getting beaten, and he never manages to successfully fly a kite. What\u2019s worse, he never gets valentines* or Christmas cards; he only gets rocks when he goes trick-or-treating on Halloween. He is prone5 to depression and anxiety, constantly wonders if he is liked or respected, and always hopes for people\u2019s approval6 and acceptance7. But he is a lovable child with a good heart and endless determination and hope. His stories strike a sympathetic chord with millions of people.\n\n\tThere are naturally many similarities between Charlie Brown and Charles M. Schulz*, the cartoonist who created Peanuts. As a matter of fact, Charles Schulz once indicated that Peanuts is autobiographical. Like Charlie Brown\u2019s parents, Schulz\u2019s father was a barber8 and his mother a housewife. Like Charlie Brown, he was timid9 and withdrawn10, and he kept a dog as a pet. Like Charlie Brown, he played for his neighborhood baseball team, and like Charlie Brown, the worried young Schulz couldn\u2019t sleep on the night before a game. Failure11 and rejection were the two themes that dominated Schulz\u2019s childhood12 and early adulthood. There is even a similarity in their names \u2014 Charlie is a nickname13 for Charles.\n\n\tThe popular saying \u201cThe harder you fall, the higher you bounce14 back\u201d is definitely true of Schulz. He made up his mind to become a cartoonist when he was seven, but his initial15 works kept getting rejected. Years later, he said he could still remember vividly \u201cthe sinking16 feeling\u201d when he received rejection notes in the mail. In World War II, Schulz was drafted into the military. After the war, he lost at least three girlfriends because they had fallen in love with other men. In 1947, he traveled to Chicago to show his works to some prospective17 publishers, only to be rejected by all of them. His response was to go back home and keep drawing, and he constantly refined his illustrations18. He took the rejections as constructive19 criticism20 and an opportunity to improve himself. Even when his own mother didn\u2019t believe in his dreams, he didn\u2019t give up. Schulz said later, \u201cI was never discouraged. I always knew I was getting closer and closer.\u201d His perseverance eventually led to the creation of Peanuts, which soon became one of the most influential and well-received comic strips of all time. He never blamed21 anyone for his failures along the way. In fact, he gave credit to his failures for making him more determined to finally achieve success22.\n\n\tThis is the spirit that the author23 attempts to convey in his comic strips. Charlie Brown never blames or takes revenge24 on those who defeat him or let him down. He keeps trying to fly a kite and keeps going to the baseball mound25 over and over again, hoping to pitch26 a winning game. He firmly believes that he will make it big someday, however difficult or unlikely that may be. \u201cDetermined\u201d is a better word to describe him than \u201cstubborn27.\u201d Life is full of frustrations and setbacks for him, and perhaps for most people.

		"cn_content": "查理．布朗，連同史努比等其他角色，是美國非常受歡迎的連環漫畫《花生漫畫》裡的主要人物之一，而此漫畫是世界上連載最久的漫畫，在全球擁有三億五千五百萬的讀者群。\n\n\t查理是少見的英雄人物。他是位長相平庸且有張圓臉的男學童。身為一位率真、正直的小孩，他幾乎展現不出如超人、蜘蛛人或蝙蝠俠那些典型英雄的特質。相反地，他的名字已經變成永遠的失敗者的同義字\u2015\u2015我們會說：「他是個不折不扣的查理．布朗。」\n\n\t他輸過無數場棒球比賽，而且當他想試著踢橄欖球時，常被露西．潘．貝魯特捉弄。他玩西洋跳棋從沒有不被打敗，他也從未成功地放過風箏。更慘的是，他從沒收過情人節卡片或聖誕節卡片；萬聖節前夕去玩「不給糖就搗蛋」時他收到的都是石頭。他很容易就感到沮喪或焦慮，時常在想別人喜不喜歡或尊不尊敬他，總是希望獲得他人的認同與接納。但他是一個擁有好心腸及無比的決心與希望的可愛小孩。他的故事讓數百萬人同情且產生共鳴。\n\n\t查理．布朗和創作出《花生漫畫》的漫畫家查爾斯．舒茲自然有許多相似點。事實上，查爾斯．舒茲曾經表示《花生漫畫》是有自傳性質的。和查理．布朗的雙親一樣，舒茲的父親是位理髮師，而他母親是位家庭主婦。和查理．布朗一樣，他也是害羞內向的，而且也養了一隻狗當寵物。和查理．布朗一樣，他在社區棒球隊打球，且和查理．布朗一樣，年輕又焦慮的舒茲在比賽前一晚也睡不著。失敗和拒絕是主宰著舒茲童年時期和成年初期的兩個主題。他們甚至連名字都很相似\u2015\u2015查理是查爾斯的暱稱。\n\n\t俗話說：「你跌得愈重，你就反彈得愈高。」這句話對舒茲來說一點都不假。他七歲時就下定決心要成為漫畫家，但他初期的作品一直被打回票。幾年後，他說他仍清楚記得當他在信件裡得到拒絕訊息時那種「跌入深淵的感覺」。二次世界大戰時，舒茲被徵召入伍。戰爭結束後，他失去了至少三個女朋友，因為她們都移情別戀了。1947年，他到芝加哥給一些可能的出版商看他的作品，結果全被他們拒絕了。他的反應是回家繼續畫，並繼續修改他的插畫。他把拒絕當作有建設性的批評和改進自己的機會。即使連他母親都不相信他的夢想時，他仍不放棄。舒茲事後說：「我從不氣餒，我一直知道我（離夢想）愈來愈近。」他的毅力最終造就了《花生漫畫》的誕生，此漫畫很快成為史上最有影響力且最廣受歡迎的漫畫之一。這一路上他從未因失敗而責備他人，事實上，他歸功於他的失敗讓他有更強的決心最終達成成功。\n\n\t這就是作者想要在漫畫裡傳達的精神。查理．布朗從未責備或報復那些打敗他或讓他失望的人。他一直努力試著放風箏，一次又一次地站上投手丘，希望能贏得一次勝投。他堅信不論有多困難或多不可能，總有一天他會成就大事業。「堅決」比起「固執己見」更適合用來形容他。他的人生充滿了挫折與失敗，也許很多人也是這樣。但卻是一顆真誠的心和永不止息的毅力讓這個世界繼續運轉，也定義了何謂真正的英雄。這樣的英雄可能是查理．布朗，也可能是我們任何一個人。",

He is a plain-looking schoolboy with a round face. A straight and upright3 kid, he displays few features of the typical heroes like Superman*, Spiderman* or Batman*. Rather, his name has become a synonym4 for the eternal loser: we say \"He is a real Charlie Brown.\"\n\n\tHe loses countless baseball games and often gets tricked by Lucy van Pelt* when he is trying to kick a football. He never plays a game of checkers* without getting beaten, and he never manages to successfully fly a kite. What\u2019s worse, he never gets valentines* or Christmas cards; he only gets rocks when he goes trick-or-treating on Halloween. He is prone5 to depression and anxiety, constantly wonders if he is liked or respected, and always hopes for people\u2019s approval6 and acceptance7. But he is a lovable child with a good heart and endless determination and hope. His stories strike a sympathetic chord with millions of people.\n\n\tThere are naturally many similarities between Charlie Brown and Charles M. Schulz*, the cartoonist who created Peanuts. As a matter of fact, Charles Schulz once indicated that Peanuts is autobiographical. Like Charlie Brown\u2019s parents, Schulz\u2019s father was a barber8 and his mother a housewife. Like Charlie Brown, he was timid9 and withdrawn10, and he kept a dog as a pet. Like Charlie Brown, he played for his neighborhood baseball team, and like Charlie Brown, the worried young Schulz couldn\u2019t sleep on the night before a game. Failure11 and rejection were the two themes that dominated Schulz\u2019s childhood12 and early adulthood. There is even a similarity in their names \u2014 Charlie is a nickname13 for Charles.\n\n\tThe popular saying \u201cThe harder you fall, the higher you bounce14 back\u201d is definitely true of Schulz. He made up his mind to become a cartoonist when he was seven, but his initial15 works kept getting rejected. Years later, he said he could still remember vividly \u201cthe sinking16 feeling\u201d when he received rejection notes in the mail. In World War II, Schulz was drafted into the military. After the war, he lost at least three girlfriends because they had fallen in love with other men. In 1947, he traveled to Chicago to show his works to some prospective17 publishers, only to be rejected by all of them. His response was to go back home and keep drawing, and he constantly refined his illustrations18. He took the rejections as constructive19 criticism20 and an opportunity to improve himself. Even when his own mother didn\u2019t believe in his dreams, he didn\u2019t give up. Schulz said later, \u201cI was never discouraged. I always knew I was getting closer and closer.\u201d His perseverance eventually led to the creation of Peanuts, which soon became one of the most influential and well-received comic strips of all time. He never blamed21 anyone for his failures along the way. In fact, he gave credit to his failures for making him more determined to finally achieve success22.\n\n\tThis is the spirit that the author23 attempts to convey in his comic strips. Charlie Brown never blames or takes revenge24 on those who defeat him or let him down. He keeps trying to fly a kite and keeps going to the baseball mound25 over and over again, hoping to pitch26 a winning game.

He is a plain-looking schoolboy with a round face. A straight and upright3 kid, he displays few features of the typical heroes like Superman*, Spiderman* or Batman*. Rather, his name has become a synonym4 for the eternal loser: we say \"He is a real Charlie Brown.\"\n\n\tHe loses countless baseball games and often gets tricked by Lucy van Pelt* when he is trying to kick a football. He never plays a game of checkers* without getting beaten, and he never manages to successfully fly a kite. What\u2019s worse, he never gets valentines* or Christmas cards; he only gets rocks when he goes trick-or-treating on Halloween. He is prone5 to depression and anxiety, constantly wonders if he is liked or respected, and always hopes for people\u2019s approval6 and acceptance7. But he is a lovable child with a good heart and endless determination and hope. His stories strike a sympathetic chord with millions of people.\n\n\tThere are naturally many similarities between Charlie Brown and Charles M. Schulz*, the cartoonist who created Peanuts. As a matter of fact, Charles Schulz once indicated that Peanuts is autobiographical. Like Charlie Brown\u2019s parents, Schulz\u2019s father was a barber8 and his mother a housewife. Like Charlie Brown, he was timid9 and withdrawn10, and he kept a dog as a pet. Like Charlie Brown, he played for his neighborhood baseball team, and like Charlie Brown, the worried young Schulz couldn\u2019t sleep on the night before a game. Failure11 and rejection were the two themes that dominated Schulz\u2019s childhood12 and early adulthood. There is even a similarity in their names \u2014 Charlie is a nickname13 for Charles.\n\n\tThe popular saying \u201cThe harder you fall, the higher you bounce14 back\u201d is definitely true of Schulz. He made up his mind to become a cartoonist when he was seven, but his initial15 works kept getting rejected. Years later, he said he could still remember vividly \u201cthe sinking16 feeling\u201d when he received rejection notes in the mail. In World War II, Schulz was drafted into the military. After the war, he lost at least three girlfriends because they had fallen in love with other men. In 1947, he traveled to Chicago to show his works to some prospective17 publishers, only to be rejected by all of them. His response was to go back home and keep drawing, and he constantly refined his illustrations18. He took the rejections as constructive19 criticism20 and an opportunity to improve himself. Even when his own mother didn\u2019t believe in his dreams, he didn\u2019t give up. Schulz said later, \u201cI was never discouraged. I always knew I was getting closer and closer.\u201d His perseverance eventually led to the creation of Peanuts, which soon became one of the most influential and well-received comic strips of all time. He never blamed21 anyone for his failures along the way. In fact, he gave credit to his failures for making him more determined to finally achieve success22.\n\n\tThis is the spirit that the author23 attempts to convey in his comic strips. Charlie Brown never blames or takes revenge24 on those who defeat him or let him down.

He is a plain-looking schoolboy with a round face. A straight and upright3 kid, he displays few features of the typical heroes like Superman*, Spiderman* or Batman*. Rather, his name has become a synonym4 for the eternal loser: we say \"He is a real Charlie Brown.\"\n\n\tHe loses countless baseball games and often gets tricked by Lucy van Pelt* when he is trying to kick a football. He never plays a game of checkers* without getting beaten, and he never manages to successfully fly a kite. What\u2019s worse, he never gets valentines* or Christmas cards; he only gets rocks when he goes trick-or-treating on Halloween. He is prone5 to depression and anxiety, constantly wonders if he is liked or respected, and always hopes for people\u2019s approval6 and acceptance7. But he is a lovable child with a good heart and endless determination and hope. His stories strike a sympathetic chord with millions of people.\n\n\tThere are naturally many similarities between Charlie Brown and Charles M. Schulz*, the cartoonist who created Peanuts. As a matter of fact, Charles Schulz once indicated that Peanuts is autobiographical. Like Charlie Brown\u2019s parents, Schulz\u2019s father was a barber8 and his mother a housewife. Like Charlie Brown, he was timid9 and withdrawn10, and he kept a dog as a pet. Like Charlie Brown, he played for his neighborhood baseball team, and like Charlie Brown, the worried young Schulz couldn\u2019t sleep on the night before a game. Failure11 and rejection were the two themes that dominated Schulz\u2019s childhood12 and early adulthood. There is even a similarity in their names \u2014 Charlie is a nickname13 for Charles.\n\n\tThe popular saying \u201cThe harder you fall, the higher you bounce14 back\u201d is definitely true of Schulz. He made up his mind to become a cartoonist when he was seven, but his initial15 works kept getting rejected. Years later, he said he could still remember vividly \u201cthe sinking16 feeling\u201d when he received rejection notes in the mail. In World War II, Schulz was drafted into the military. After the war, he lost at least three girlfriends because they had fallen in love with other men. In 1947, he traveled to Chicago to show his works to some prospective17 publishers, only to be rejected by all of them. His response was to go back home and keep drawing, and he constantly refined his illustrations18. He took the rejections as constructive19 criticism20 and an opportunity to improve himself. Even when his own mother didn\u2019t believe in his dreams, he didn\u2019t give up. Schulz said later, \u201cI was never discouraged. I always knew I was getting closer and closer.\u201d His perseverance eventually led to the creation of Peanuts, which soon became one of the most influential and well-received comic strips of all time. He never blamed21 anyone for his failures along the way. In fact, he gave credit to his failures for making him more determined to finally achieve success22.\n\n\tThis is the spirit that the author23 attempts to convey in his comic strips. Charlie Brown never blames or takes revenge24 on those who defeat him or let him down. He keeps trying to fly a kite and keeps going to the baseball mound25 over and over again, hoping to pitch26 a winning game.

		"en_content": "Charlie Brown is one of the main characters, along with Snoopy* and others, in the extremely popular American comic strip1 Peanuts*, the longest-running comic strip in the world with a readership2 of 355 million worldwide.\n\n\tCharlie is an unusual choice for a hero. He is a plain-looking schoolboy with a round face. A straight and upright3 kid, he displays few features of the typical heroes like Superman*, Spiderman* or Batman*. Rather, his name has become a synonym4 for the eternal loser: we say \"He is a real Charlie Brown.\"\n\n\tHe loses countless baseball games and often gets tricked by Lucy van Pelt* when he is trying to kick a football. He never plays a game of checkers* without getting beaten, and he never manages to successfully fly a kite. What\u2019s worse, he never gets valentines* or Christmas cards; he only gets rocks when he goes trick-or-treating on Halloween. He is prone5 to depression and anxiety, constantly wonders if he is liked or respected, and always hopes for people\u2019s approval6 and acceptance7. But he is a lovable child with a good heart and endless determination and hope. His stories strike a sympathetic chord with millions of people.\n\n\tThere are naturally many similarities between Charlie Brown and Charles M. Schulz*, the cartoonist who created Peanuts. As a matter of fact, Charles Schulz once indicated that Peanuts is autobiographical. Like Charlie Brown\u2019s parents, Schulz\u2019s father was a barber8 and his mother a housewife. Like Charlie Brown, he was timid9 and withdrawn10, and he kept a dog as a pet. Like Charlie Brown, he played for his neighborhood baseball team, and like Charlie Brown, the worried young Schulz couldn\u2019t sleep on the night before a game. Failure11 and rejection were the two themes that dominated Schulz\u2019s childhood12 and early adulthood. There is even a similarity in their names \u2014 Charlie is a nickname13 for Charles.\n\n\tThe popular saying \u201cThe harder you fall, the higher you bounce14 back\u201d is definitely true of Schulz. He made up his mind to become a cartoonist when he was seven, but his initial15 works kept getting rejected. Years later, he said he could still remember vividly \u201cthe sinking16 feeling\u201d when he received rejection notes in the mail. In World War II, Schulz was drafted into the military. After the war, he lost at least three girlfriends because they had fallen in love with other men. In 1947, he traveled to Chicago to show his works to some prospective17 publishers, only to be rejected by all of them. His response was to go back home and keep drawing, and he constantly refined his illustrations18. He took the rejections as constructive19 criticism20 and an opportunity to improve himself. Even when his own mother didn\u2019t believe in his dreams, he didn\u2019t give up. Schulz said later, \u201cI was never discouraged. I always knew I was getting closer and closer.\u201d His perseverance eventually led to the creation of Peanuts, which soon became one of the most influential and well-received comic strips of all time. He never blamed21 anyone for his failures along the way. In fact, he gave credit to his failures for making him more determined to finally achieve success22.\n\n\tThis is the spirit that the author23 attempts to convey in his comic strips. Charlie Brown never blames or takes revenge24 on those who defeat him or let him down. He keeps trying to fly a kite and keeps going to the baseball mound25 over and over again, hoping to pitch26 a winning game. He firmly believes that he will make it big someday, however difficult or unlikely that may be. \u201cDetermined\u201d is a better word to describe him than \u201cstubborn27.\u201d Life is full of frustrations and setbacks for him, and perhaps for most people. But it is a kind heart and endless persistence28 that keep the world moving and define29 a true hero. That hero could be Charlie Brown, or any one of us.",
